# Stock-Market-Data-Pipeline-Web-Scraping-Cleaning-Visualization-with-Python

**Project Overview
**
This project builds an end-to-end Python workflow for extracting, cleaning, and visualizing financial data for publicly traded companies. Using Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) as case studies, the project demonstrates how to create a reproducible data pipeline that collects both historical stock prices and quarterly revenue data, combines them, and visualizes trends in a clear dashboard format.

The work combines API-driven data extraction (yfinance) with web scraping (BeautifulSoup) to gather information from multiple data sources. After scraping and parsing HTML tables, the data undergoes cleaning—removing symbols, handling missing values, and normalizing formats—before being visualized using a custom Matplotlib dashboard function.

This project is part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate (Course 5) and showcases essential industry-level skills: data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory visualization, and dashboard creation.
